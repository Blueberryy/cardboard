About Map:
- This map is totally inspired by my favorite game Hexen.
- Theme is based on mixture of Spell+Tech textures.
- It's 2-4 players FFA map. It will have bigger version soon.
- Around 120+ working hours went into this map.

Thanks to:
- Ao1|Pointblank and Galaxy, my cH' clanmates for layout.
- Redon and Doko for pointing out mistakes and helping for layout/style.
- All players who tested it on cH' Clan Server...
//It's unusual to see 12+ players in 1 moment, playing FFA on Coop-Edit in 2018.
//More than 20 was on server during the night :3
